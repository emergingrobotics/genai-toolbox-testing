# Google MCP Toolbox for Databases testing

We are going to test Google MCP Toolbox for Databases.  It's source is cloned into ./genai-toolbox

However, we will run it in a container.  The folder ./configs will hold config files.  

Read ./server/notes.md for instructions on how to download and run the container.  We created ./server/scripts to hold scripts to do this for us.

Read ./configs/notes.md for instructions on how to create config files for the server.
